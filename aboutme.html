        <p class = "more about me"> In the last couple of years, my courses have given me a 
            combination of both the theoretical and the practical sides of my field. 
            I have completed several projects, team tasks and developed various sets 
            of skills in application and web development. In these fast-paced environments, 
            I worked effectively under pressure to meet my deadlines. I am positive in my skills 
            and well versed in web development, data structures, OOPS, and can implement in Python, 
            Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js.I have demonstrated multiple times that 
            I am a great team player who is able to adapt quickly to change. 
            This gave me total exposure and experience to the skills involved in producing 
            efficient code, adhering to standards, polishing my skills along the way, and the 
            teamwork needed to complete tasks on time.
